Logistic Regression for Diabetes Analysis
We have a dataset of patients with diabetes and their respective 
independent variables such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc. We can use logistic 
regression to analyze the relationship between these independent variables and 
whether a patient has diabetes or not. We also did some EDA to understand the 
relationship between different features in order to get better insights about the 
dataset. 
For hypothesis purpose we defined null and alternative hypothesis.The 
alternative hypothesis (H1) would be that there is a significant association, while 
the null hypothesis (H0) would be that there is no significant relationship between 
the independent factors and diabetes.
Next, we used a significance test (chi-square test, Shapiro-Wilk 
Test,MannWhitneyU Test) to determine whether our findings are statistically 
significant. If the p-value is less than our predetermined significance level 
(usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a 
significant relationship between the independent variables and diabetes.
The degree and direction of the association between each independent 
variable and diabetes can be determined by interpreting the logistic regression 
coefficients, assuming we reject the null hypothesis and discover a significant 
relationship. For instance, a positive coefficient for BMI would mean that the risk 
of having diabetes rises as BMI rises.
